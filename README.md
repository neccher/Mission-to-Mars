# Mission-to-Mars
In the hopes of impressing NASA, we wanted to create a webpage to inform users all about Mars.  The webpage will scrape various websites for the latest news, facts, and images of the Red Planet.  Once the content was put in place, we needed to style the page up a little.  I chose to color the "Scrape New Data" button red and turn the hemisphere images into circles.  The website is also mobile friendly!
